# Algorithm Visualization - Bubble Sort

## Overview

Algorithm Visualization is a C# Windows Forms application that provides a visual representation of the Bubble Sort algorithm. This project focuses on visualizing the inner workings of the Bubble Sort algorithm, making it easier to understand how this sorting technique operates.

**Key Features:**

- **Random Number Generation:** You can generate a list of random numbers to be sorted using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

- **Step-by-Step Visualization:** The application enables you to step through the Bubble Sort algorithm, visually illustrating how elements are compared and swapped.

- **Reverse Sorted Array:** You can observe the Bubble Sort algorithm in action on a reverse-sorted array.
  
- **Unit Tests:**
This project includes unit tests for the Bubble Sort algorithm using MSTest. The tests ensure the correctness of the Bubble Sort algorithm implementation. You can extend these tests if you wish to cover more scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Visual Studio or any C# development environment.
- .NET Framework installed on your machine.
